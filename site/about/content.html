	<h4>Our History</h4>

	<p>FIC got its start in the early 1970s working exclusively with financial institutions. There was a great need in the marketplace for REO coverage as well as force-placed insurance and we filled that void allowing us to focus on financial institutions and their clients over the next thirty-five years. Both FIC principals have military backgrounds, which explains the attention to detail that we devote to all our clients’ business. One principle of military leadership we follow is “task and purpose.” We never give someone a task without providing the purpose behind it so that they can take initiative. You’ll find this trait embedded in our team members who go above the call of duty to make sure to quickly provide the solution you need. Our core specialization and detailed service has helped protect our clients and their clients for decades.</p>
