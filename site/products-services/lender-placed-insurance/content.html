	<h4>Collateral (Movables) Insurance </h4>

	<p>As a lender, protecting your collateral from physical damage while maintaining compliance is imperative. FIC has over thirty years&rsquo; experience in helping lenders achieve this in the simplest manner possible.</p>

	<p>FIC provides an easy, flexible means to manage the coverage for your collateral portfolios minimizing risk and protecting your interest. Reporting coverage is simple through FIC&rsquo;s proprietary online system, <a href="/protector-portal">Protector</a>, which allows all types of coverage to be managed through the same platform. </p>

	<p>FIC acts as General Agent for multiple A Rated insurance carriers. This helps your institution or agency as you&rsquo;re dealing with the insurance carrier&rsquo;s representative, eliminating delays and bureaucracy.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Your policy insures you as the lender and your borrower.</li>
		<li>Broad coverages and high limits are available.</li>
		<li>Quick and streamlined claims are handled through our office.</li>
		<li>Flexible terms allow variable rates, deductibles and customized coverage.</li>
		<li>Pro-rata refunds are processed quickly and directly to you.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Lender-Placed Letter Service</h4>

	<p>FIC&rsquo;s Letter Service eliminates the biggest headache in lender-placed insurance compliance—sending letters to your borrowers. Simply add your borrowers&rsquo; coverage deficiency to <a href="/protector-portal">Protector</a> (our online system), and rely on FIC to send compliant letters to your borrowers. And you stay in control of your lender-placed insurance program.</p>

	<p>FIC issues a single master policy for the institution, allowing the institution to add coverage for properties in which they have an interest. Once the master policy is issued, individual properties are not underwritten unless they are outside the policy limits.</p>
